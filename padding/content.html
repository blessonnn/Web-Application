            <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a prolific and influential
                composer of the Classical period. Despite his short life, 
                his rapid pace of composition and proficiency from an early
                age resulted in more than 800 works representing 
                virtually every Western classical genre of his time</p>
